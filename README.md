# Military Classes Mod (working title)

Adds several new classes to allow for more character progression. Progression in each class requires two different attributes and the classes are themed to match those attributes.

Each tier of a class is unlocked at player levels 50, 60, 70, 80 and 100.

## Classes

### Sergeant (Strength/Perception)

A powerhouse of heavy firearms, the sergeant can lay down a hail of bullets sufficient to take out any horde of zombies. May seem slightly unhinged, but only because they care about guns more than people.

* Intimidating (passive) - All nearby zombies have their movement and attack speed slowed by 30%
* Military Training - Reduce recoil with all weapons by 40%
* Advanced Ammunition - Craft armor piercing and hollow point rounds
* Rifleman - Craft the HK416, a modern assault rifle that features an adjustable stock to suit all ranges of combat
* Terminator - Craft the minigun and rain lead on your enemies in 5mm servings

### Captain (Strength/Intelligence)

The mark of a good leader is their ability to inspire those under their command. Direct operations and provide oversight to your team, improving their capabilities when working as a group.

* Mining Foreman (passive) - You and all nearby allies receive +30% to block damage
* Convoy Commander (passive) - All nearby vehicles move 30% faster
* Wireless Communications - Craft the Comms Headset, a helmet mod that allows party members to receive your buffs from up to 200m away
* Inspiring leader (passive) - All nearby allies receive +1 to Intelligence, Strength and Perception
* 

### Stalker (Strength/Agility)

The knife, it is said, is the last thing you learn. The closer you get to being a pro, the closer you can get to the target. Never seen or heard, the stalker can slice their way through a horde of zombies and leave without a trace.

* Padfoot - Reduces sound penalty for light armor by 50% and increases stealth movement speed by 30%
* Assassin - Doubles sneak damage with melee weapons
* Knife in the Dark - Craft the dagger, a melee weapon that can be thrown in a tough scenario and retrieved from the enemy's body
* Tools of the Trade - Craft a variety of toxins that can be applied to the dagger
* Great Escape - Craft smoke bombs, which cause you to disappear from sight for 5 seconds

### SpecOps (Perception/Agility)

Don't run to your death. 90% of execution is about taking your time, planning your shot, considering the possibilities. When it is time to plan, plan; when it is time to act, act. In everything you do, do it without reservation and never look back. Those who waste time thinking about what could have been are a liability to themselves and others.

* Silent Killer - Increase damage with silenced weapons by 30%
* Always Ready - Increase weapon swap speed by 50% and reload speed by 30%
* Packs a punch - Craft the five-seven, a powerful pistol that comes silenced as standard
* Snap Shot - Increase aiming speed with pistols and SMGs by 40%
* Flash Out! - Craft stun grenades, which leave enemies dazed and disoriented for 5 seconds

### Hunter (Fortitude/Agility)

The wonder of nature knows no bounds; an endless diversity of creatures all vying for survival against each other and the elements. For each prey, there is a predator. For each predator, an apex predator. For each apex predator, a hunter. Through rapid innovation, humans have outclassed the slow crawl of base evolution. If it takes fish ten million years to learn how to avoid being caught, it will take humans ten months to find a new way of catching them.

* Fletcher - Craft arrows using polymer fletching. These will not fly as far but can be handy when feathers are in short supply.
* Master Tracker (passive) - Detect nearby animals, and see them outlined in red
* Nomad - Reduce stamina drain while drawing a bow by 50%. Craft the reflex bow and take your hunting to the next level.
* Prime Cut - Increase resources harvested from animals. Harvest special resources such as bear hide, snakeskin, etc.
* See My Vest - Craft a set of light armor that provides ample protection from both zombies and the elements

### Quartermaster (Fortitude/Intelligence)

Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other. Any military camp has an ever-shifting list of requirements, yet everyone seems to assume these things "just get done". The quartermaster specializes in getting things done, whether it's providing a hearty meal when you return from patrol or coming up with some much needed item just in time.

* Prepper - Cook Field Rations, which provide a good amount of sustenance for relatively simple ingredients
* Under Counter - Increase reload speed and reduce spread when using shotguns
* BBQ Master - Cook any item on a campfire without the need for grills, pots or beakers
* Storage Wars - Increase loot bonus by 200
* Backpacker - Craft the extended backpack, which adds another 10 slots to your inventory


### Mechanic (Intelligence/Agility)

Engineering is often misunderstood. Those outside the profession think of people in lab coats writing equations on blackboards, discussing hypotheses and coming to a consensus on the best way forward. Save that stuff for the sales pitch or the company website. The reality is a small team of innovative grease monkeys working 14 hour shifts in the dirt and grime under the hood. The final product is tied together with shoestring and chewing gum, but it works, and that is what makes it perfect.

* Production Line - Increase crafting speed by 50%
* Tinkerer - Increase resources from salvage by 50%
* All Terrain - Craft the Armored Personnel Carrier, which can carry up to 6 characters
* Mad Genius - Craft a plethora of new traps to deal with the zombie hordes
* Airlift - Craft the Blackhawk

### Juggernaut (Fortitude/Strength)

There are many problems that require a well constructed plan of execution and a tactical approach to problem solving. There are also many that do not. The juggernaut is an expert in dealing with the latter type of problem. Covered head to toe in the heaviest armor possible and swinging weapons most people would struggle to lift, the juggernaut smashes through zombies as if they weren't even there.

* Carry a Big Stick - Craft the steel sledgehammer
* Chainsaw Massacre - Increase chainsaw damage by 250% and dismemberment chance by 45%
* Evil Dead - Craft the reinforced chainsaw, built for hewing through hordes of zombies
* Tank - Increase armor defense and durability by 25%, increase mobility by 90%
* Killdozer - Craft the Rebar Armor set, which severely reduces mobility but makes you near-indestructible

### Medic (Fortitude/Perception)

The medic is clearly not a doctor, but you know what they say about beggars and choosers. Field dressings and tinctures, while not as fancy as modern healthcare, can mean the difference between life and death. This is the one person you don't want to get on the bad side of. Next time you're nauseous and bleeding out from a zombie bite, remember who will have your back.

* Professional Opinion - You and all nearby allies heal for 1hp every 5 seconds
* Trauma Soother - Craft Trauma Blankets, which can be used to comfort allies and negate near-death trauma
* 
*

### Hacker (Intelligence/Perception)

The term "hacker" may evoke images of men wearing balaclavas while using a laptop, but what it truly represents is a fundamental way of thinking about the world. Hackers can take any system and consider the edge cases; the breaking points; the lynchpins that keeps the whole thing running. Every time they walk into a building, their eyes flick to the cameras, the security room, the fire exit: not because of ill intent, but rather to understand how everything fits together. The line between "how would I?" and "how will I?", however, is less well defined than you may think.
